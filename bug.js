This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` component with custom `styles` and the `ratio` prop.  The issue is that the styles are not correctly applied, leading to incorrect aspect ratios or rendering issues. The problem appears to be related to how Expo handles style calculations in conjunction with the aspect ratio constraint.  For instance, setting `style={{ flex: 1 }}` along with a `ratio` prop might not result in the expected dimensions and aspect ratio.
