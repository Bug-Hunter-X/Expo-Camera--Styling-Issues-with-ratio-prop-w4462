The solution involves using a container to manage the aspect ratio. By setting the aspect ratio of the container, the Camera component within will respect the correct dimensions, even with flexible styling.  Here's how you can fix it:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Camera, View } from 'expo-camera';

const CameraComponent = () => {
  // ... other camera logic

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}> {/* Container with aspect ratio */}
      <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} {...cameraProps} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default CameraComponent;
```
This wraps the Camera component in a `View` with the desired `aspectRatio`. The `flex: 1` on both the View and the Camera ensures that the Camera fills the container while maintaining the correct aspect ratio.
